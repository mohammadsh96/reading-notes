## Code 102 - Intro to Software Development

Software development is a complicated process comprising many stages. Each stage requires a
lot of paperwork and documentation in addition to the development and planning process. This
is in contrast to the common thinking of newcomers to the software industry who believe that
software development is just “writing code.” Each software development project has to go
through at least the following stages:
• Requirement gathering
• Writing functional specifications
• Creating architecture and design documents
• Implementation and coding
• Testing and quality assurance
• Software release
• Documentation
• Support and new features
