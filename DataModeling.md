# SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences
-**SQL** 
-**NoSQL** .
| SQL                                      | NoSQL                                                  |

|  databases are table based databases  |databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores  | databases have predefined schema| databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data|databases are vertically scalable|databases are horizontally scalable|databases are scaled by increasing he horse-power of the hardware| databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.| databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful| queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)|are good fit for the complex query intensive environment |databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level,|databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.|fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.|QL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server|databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.| databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data|you can use NoSQL for transactions purpose, it is still not comparable and sable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications.|Excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors. There are also lot of independent consultations who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale deployments|database you still have to rely on community support, and only limited outside experts are available for you to setup and deploy your large scale NoSQL deployments.|emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency|database follows the Brewers CAP theorem|
